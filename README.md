## B.Tech Major Project (Final Year)
### PREDICTMEDIX – Medical Cost Prediction Using Machine Learning

PREDICTMEDIX is a B.Tech final year major academic project developed as part of the Computer Science and Engineering curriculum.  
The project focuses on predicting individual medical insurance costs using machine learning techniques based on demographic and lifestyle-related data.

## Project Overview

Rising healthcare expenses make accurate medical cost prediction important for both individuals and insurance providers.  
This project applies data-driven machine learning models to estimate medical insurance charges using structured datasets.

The dataset includes attributes such as:
- Age
- Gender
- Body Mass Index (BMI)
- Smoking status
- Number of dependents
- Region

---

## Methodology

The project follows a standard machine learning workflow:
1. Data collection and understanding
2. Data preprocessing and cleaning
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
4. Feature engineering
5. Model training
6. Model evaluation and comparison

---

## Machine Learning Models Used

- Linear Regression
- Decision Tree Regressor
- Random Forest Regressor
- Gradient Boosting (experimental)
- Support Vector Regression (SVR)

---

## Evaluation Metrics

Models are evaluated using:
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- R² Score

Random Forest Regressor provided improved accuracy compared to baseline models.
